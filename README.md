# Sales Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict future sales based on historical sales data and advertising expenditures. Using a linear regression model, we analyze past sales patterns, advertising spending, and other relevant factors to forecast sales figures for future periods. By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic planning.

## Project Structure
- `sales_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training (using linear regression), evaluation, and prediction.
- `advertising.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing, including historical sales data and advertising expenditures.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prateek0809/Sales_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sales_Prediction
   ```

3. Open the `sales_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using the linear regression algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset (`advertising.csv`) used in this project contains historical sales data and advertising expenditures, including the following features:
- TV: Advertising spend on TV
- Radio: Advertising spend on radio
- Newspaper: Advertising spend on newspapers
- Sales: Sales figures

## Contribution
If you're excited about learning and want to contribute, here's how:

- Report Issues: If you encounter any problems or have questions, feel free to open an issue.
- Enhance Documentation: If you find any explanations unclear, improve the documentation to help others understand better.
- Extend Functionality: You can add new features, algorithms, or visualizations to expand the project's scope.

Remember, this project is a hands-on learning experience. Embrace challenges, ask questions, and enjoy the journey into the world of machine learning!

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the classic Iris dataset and aims to provide a practical learning opportunity for college students interested in machine learning. It builds a foundation for understanding data preprocessing, model building, and result analysis.
