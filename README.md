# Codsoft_task4

During my role as a Data Science Intern at CodSoft for GitHub, I had the chance to work on a sales prediction project. I analyzed historical sales data, customer demographics, and market trends to develop accurate predictive models. I refined my Python coding skills, delved into data preprocessing, and explored machine learning techniques. I also created insightful visualizations to showcase sales patterns and predictions. This experience not only deepened my technical abilities but also gave me a practical understanding of data-driven decision-making's business impact.
